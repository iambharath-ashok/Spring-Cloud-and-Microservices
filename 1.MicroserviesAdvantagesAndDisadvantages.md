# Micro-services

## Monolithic Architecture

-	Application will be deployed on Application Server
-	Application will be deployed as single big entity 
-	Several modules will be combined and build into single entity and deployed as single enitity


## Disadvantages of Monolithic Architecture

-	More Downtime 
-	Needs to bring whole application for changes in the one side of the corner
-	Scalability is big issue and difficult to scale automatically at runtime 


## Advantages of Micro-services

-	Blue-green deployement
-	Higher scalability
-	More Availability
-	Deployed separately and flexibility
	-	 But work with each other at runtime
-	Technology Flexibility



## Disadvantages of Micro-services

-	Deployment/ Architecture Complexity
-	Knowledge of lots of new technologies
-	Service Discovery
	-	Client instead of calling the services directly 
	-	Services will be invoked from the Eureka Service discovery
